# rusty-hangman
CLI Hangman game written in rust.


~~Checkout SPEC.md for this project's specification.~~

Actually, I am too lazy to edit that doc so to play, just clone, compile, then run

```
./target/debug/hangman <args>
```

Make sure that your current directory when running the above is from the `rusty-hangman` directory level.
